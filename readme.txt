== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

* "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wordpress.org usernames
* "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
* "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
* "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*
* Stable tag must indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version

Note that the `readme.txt` value of stable tag is the one that is the defining one for the plugin.  If the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used for displaying information about the plugin.

If you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

If no stable tag is provided, your users may not get the correct version of your code.
