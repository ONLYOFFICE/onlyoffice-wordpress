## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that is resolvable and connectable both from WordPress and any end clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to WordPress directly.

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.

## Configuring ONLYOFFICE Docs plugin for WordPress

Configure the plugin via the WordPress interface. Go to **WordPress administrative dashboard -> ONLYOFFICE Docs -> Settings** and specify the following parameters:

- **Document Editing Service address**:
  The URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

- **Document server JWT secret key**:
  Starting from version 7.2, JWT is enabled by default and the secret key is generated automatically to restrict the access to ONLYOFFICE Docs and for security reasons and data integrity. Specify your own secret key in the WordPress administrative configuration. In the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/additional-api/signature/), specify the same secret key and enable the validation.

## Using ONLYOFFICE Docs plugin for WordPress

ONLYOFFICE Docs plugin allows WordPress administrators to open files for collaborative editing using ONLYOFFICE Docs (online document editors). In published posts, the editors are visible to all WordPress site visitors (both authorized and unauthorized) in the Embedded mode only.

**Editing files uploaded to WordPress**

All uploaded files from the Media section will appear on the ONLYOFFICE Docs -> Files page. The editor opens in the same tab by clicking on the file name. Users with administrator rights are able to co-edit documents. All the changes are saved in the same file.

**Creating a post**

When creating a post, you can add the ONLYOFFICE Docs element (block) and then upload a new file or select one from the Media Library. The added file will be displayed as the ONLYOFFICE logo with the file name in the currently edited post. After the post is published (when you press the Publish or Update button), your WordPress site visitors will have access to this file for viewing in the Embedded mode.
